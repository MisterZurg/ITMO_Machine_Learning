## Labs
1. Lab 1 — Supervised learning algorithms
2. Lab 2 — NLP
3. Lab 3 — Optimization algorithms implementation
4. Lab 4 — Backpropagation
5. Lab 5 —  CNN & Transfer Learning

## Extra Lab
> Apply t-SNE to MNIST to 3 components to visualize it in 3D
> 
> Choose parameters (perplexity, n_iter, etc. so the results of Rand Index of t-SNE should be larger than 95 %)
> 1. t-SNE on MNIST datasat
> 2. Calculate Rand Index for 3D transformation if its 95%+
